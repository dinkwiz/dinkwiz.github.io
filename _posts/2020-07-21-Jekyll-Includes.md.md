Written in html, reference of js and css files.
No longer restricted by Jekyll themes. Anything goes. Find a html/css/JavaScript element that you like the look of. Write your own code if you can or adapt someone else’s.

W3 schools great for basics and learning html.
Also Dev Ed for YouTube tutorials.

I’ve also added some of my includes below. Note, this will not be perfect examples of code as I’m just learning myself but they do what I need them to.

• Header (navbar)
• Project gallery
• Tools used
• Post lists
• Footer
