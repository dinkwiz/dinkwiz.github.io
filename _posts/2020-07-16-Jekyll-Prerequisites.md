You can [set up a Jekyll site through GitHub](https://dinkwiz.github.io/Jekyll-Easy-Way.html) in up just a few hours and with very little technical knowledge, using an existing theme. While these themes look simple on the surface, there is a lot going on behind the scenes. Without an understanding of this, it’s hard to know where to start with customising your site.

To begin, you’ll need to understand [how Jekyll builds sites](https://dinkwiz.github.io/Jekyll-Structure.html).

For the theme itself, you will need to get to grips with the CSS/html/JavaScript underpinning it, where the different elements (pages, includes) are used and how they link together. You’ll need to unpick the theme designer’s thought process and need to have a similar level of CSS/html/JavaScript skills to understand what each element does.

As I was new to CSS, html and JavaScript I took a different approach, deciding to start with a blank slate and build my own site. This meant I added elements piece by piece and by doing so understood what each element does, why it is there and how it connects to the rest of the site.

Before getting started on a Jekyll site, you’ll need to:

1.	**Install Ruby**. Jekyll runs on Ruby, so in order to run Jekyll you’ll need to install Ruby first.
Ruby site
Install

2. **Install Jekyll**

3. **Install Git and Git Bash** - set up instructions for this....?
4. **Choose and install a text editor**. Atom. Text editor options....?
