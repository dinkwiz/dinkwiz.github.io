Now you've got the basics of your site set up, it's time to customise it. The site still has a simple structure and as you have built this up from scratch, hopefully you have an understanding of the different elements and how they link together.

#### Adding Includes

There are three stages to includes:

1. Write the include html within the \_includes folder. 
2. Add the Liquid Include statement where you want the element to be included. E.g. in a partocular page, or within a layout design.
3. Style your element within the style.css file.

I have created further includes to customise my own site. You can find the code for these on this site.
