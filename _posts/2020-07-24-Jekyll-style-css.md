CSS adds style to your site. 

We will need to specify the style for each element within our site. We can begin by adding some global styles. These will be the default styles applied to every element within the site. We can then customise each element and override these global styles if we wish.

#### Global Styles











<hr class="line">

#### Header and Footer Style



<hr class="line">

#### Page Title Style





<hr class="line">

#### Post List Style





<hr class="line">

#### SASS

You will be beginning to see that the style.css file can become quite lengthy. We have added a few simple style elements and already reached over XXX lines. 

You may want to use SASS to organise your CSS code. SASS is a friendlier way of writing your style code. It can then be converted to CSS so Jekyll can read it. Most text editors have an extension which will automatically convert your SASS code to CSS.
