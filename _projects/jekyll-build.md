#### Introduction

Using Jekyll with GitHub Pages is a fantastic way to easily set up a site, blog and start writing. You need very little technical knowledge, especially if you set it up through GitHub's GUI. GitHub offers a range of templates you can choose from, learn some basic markdown and away you go.

I have very little experience with web development so set up a GitHub pages as a starting point. I also followed a tutorial which allowed me to customise the site to a certain degree. This tutorial had taught me the basics of how Jekyll works, Git Bash commands, folder set ups, the config file and Liquid. I had a fully-functioning website, including a portfolio and blog. It looked really great on the surface but I didn't fully understand what was going on underneath. The style and layout of pages were based on the Jekyll theme I had installed. CSS, Bootstrap and Javascript worked behind the scenes to display my content. If I wanted to make changes, I'd need to understand how Jekyll themes were built and set up in order to alter them. And so as the saying goes: If it ain't broke...., OK I broke it.

I had two options:

1. Work through the code in my current theme line by line and work out what each part controlled.
2. Remove the current theme and rebuild it section by section.

I chose the latter. I hope there will be a greater sense of satisfaction once the site is finished. I will be able to confidently explain how the site was built and what the purpose of each section is. I'll also be able to include my own learnings and notes within the site code so I'll have something to refer back to.

N.B. If you think this site looks rubbish, if the navigation is broken or it's a nightmare to use - congratulations on finding this page - it means I have accomplished something. It also means that this project is still In Progress!!

#### Aim
- Set up a Jekyll site from scratch. Design my own Jekyll theme, in order to learn how the website is built from the ground up.
- Gain an understanding of all the elements that go into a Jekyll theme and in the process how to make changes to the layout design.

#### Posts
